                    <p> With her best ability being telepathy,
                        Eleven is the main character of the show.
                        From being experimented on in Hawkins to finding
                        her new home with the Byers, she is the key to fighting
                        evil in the upside down. She is dating Mike and the legal daughter
                        of Jim Hopper and Joyce Byers, being a sister of Will therefore.

                    <p> With his best ability being the heart
                        of the group, Mike has a certain leadership
                        aspect that the group suffers without. He is 
                        a brother to Nancy and Molly Wheeler, and was
                        the first one to find Eleven in the woods after she ran from the lab. 
                        They eventually formed a bond, and are in a relationship
                        ever since.

                        Dustin never fails to make the audience love his nerdy personality.
                        He is in a relationship with Suzie who he met in a camp, and is a vital part of
                        figuring out solutions when times get tough for the group.

                    <p>With his best ability being his wrist rocket, Lucas always has 
                        an attraction to defend the group. In a relationship with Max Mayfield,
                        Lucas dealt with the hardship of his girlfriend losing her brother, while
                        also having a split on hanging out with his old friends or the new cool kids. He is the 
                        brother of Erica Sinclair.
